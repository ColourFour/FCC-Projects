      <h2>Spartan Ultra</h2>
      <p>Set against the breathtaking alpine scenery of Genting Snow Park in Chongli, Hebei—a venue that once hosted the Winter Olympic Games and sits at over 1,500 meters above sea level with 80 % mountainous terrain and 52 % forest cover— the Chongli Spartan Ultra is an unrelenting 50 kilometer obstacle course featuring more than 60 of Spartan's signature challenges, from brutal carries and rope climbs to wall scaling and mud crawls. Designed for the world's toughest endurance athletes, participants battle relentless elevation gain, unpredictable mountain weather, and the thrill of racing under the open sky before dawn breaks. Finishers earn a coveted custom belt buckle, a unique Ultra wedge to complete their Trifecta collection, and an exclusive finisher's T-shirt—symbols of a triumph few can claim. Embrace the Spartan creed, test your limits, and discover what you are truly made of at the Chongli Spartan Ultra.</p>
